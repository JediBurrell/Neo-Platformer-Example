# Neo-Platformer-Example

This is a basic example of how to use Neo to create a platformer in Kotlin!  
You can use this code freely as a base or read up on the source to figure out how to use the Neo library.

This contains a fully working game on jumping around, colliding with surfaces and walls as well as easing. This is not meant to be a full-fledged game, pull requests will only be accepted if it fixes a bug or makes the user experience better. The Neo library must be used in the project to run.
